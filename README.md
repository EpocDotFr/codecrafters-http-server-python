Source code of my solution to the CodeCrafters' "[Build your own HTTP server](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/http-server)"
challenge.

I've put myself a personal challenge: do not use any third-party packages (only use built-in Python features). As Python
has a built-in HTTP server and facilities (e.g URL parsing), it would be too easy. I did not use these neither.
